Plug sd reader into iPad, import into Lightroom into an album, and start syncing it to the cloud automatically, it\u2019s done before you\u2019re home and you can give a proofing link directly from Lightroom to a person - skips export and render time, manual upload and wait times.<br><br>That person selects what they like and you can automatically make another album from that within Lightroom - no need to select by hand.<br><br>You can make edits, the images are already synced to the cloud, the images don\u2019t need re-uploading, just the edit metadata.<br><br>You can share that album directly with a person via a link from Lightroom without need for render, export, upload.<br><br>Any changes? They can be an instant adjustment with very little work.<br><br><br>The workflow is vastly superior and can be done from an iPad (or Android tablet too, Affinity has no Android app though).","time":1588891957,"resto":75795295},{"no":75800771,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)18:55:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75795295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75795295<\/a><br>I pirate all my software so I get the best of bothworlds<br>Glad I don&#039;t have to use the shitty freeware while also paying nothing","filename":"74c58de1439851892d35533f983a85b1","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":675,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1588892142424,"time":1588892142,"md5":"LUQmDCjc+bUFg3Nn8fzbkA==","fsize":121995,"resto":75795295},{"no":75801131,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)19:22:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75800771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75800771<\/a><br>Based.<br>Adobe and autodesk&#039;s prices are aimed at studios since they legally have to have a licence. unless your primary living is from them there is no reason to even consider going legal.<br>There are other much cheaper software though, but I already have a pirated copy of everything I ever need.","time":1588893754,"resto":75795295},{"no":75801171,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)19:25:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75795295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75795295<\/a><br>just pirate and crack photoshop<br>gimp was and is always shit","filename":"","ext":".gif","w":220,"h":166,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1588893906477,"time":1588893906,"md5":"vqBd95UiZO9xHFo0TVFq2w==","fsize":113487,"resto":75795295},{"no":75802157,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:41:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"there is no reason FOR <a href=\"#p75800679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75800679<\/a> to use photoshop, LEARN THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE","time":1588898508,"resto":75795295}],"last_modified":1588898508},{"no":75801489,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)19:49:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m thinking about learning Haskell as my first programming lenguage, is this is a good idea?","filename":"1588875610390","ext":".gif","w":346,"h":367,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":249,"tim":1588895343032,"time":1588895343,"md5":"GsNQqBGUkEBmGyPOhUl5vA==","fsize":521933,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-thinking-about-learning-haskell-as-my-first","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1,"last_replies":[{"no":75801915,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:22:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75801489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75801489<\/a><br>Is that Renge?","time":1588897345,"resto":75801489},{"no":75801969,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75801900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75801900<\/a><br>Yep, i don&#039;t mind it being exactly markatable i just want something intituive really.","time":1588897613,"resto":75801489},{"no":75802053,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:33:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75801969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75801969<\/a><br>Haskell seems like one of the least intuitive languages.<br><br>I mean, if you&#039;re doing it out of pure enjoyment and without expecting any return (as in, getting a job as an Haskell programmer) I say go for it!<br><br>I wish people would enjoy programming more instead of trying to optimise their marketability all the time.","time":1588898009,"resto":75801489},{"no":75802061,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:34:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"It would teach a lot of useful concepts that you could be applied to other languages as well.","time":1588898042,"resto":75801489},{"no":75802137,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)20:40:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p75801969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;75801969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;intituive<\/span><br>Lol.

I know the title of this thread&#039;s &#039;Discord alternative&#039; but the main issue&#039;s slightly different.<br><br>I&#039;m part of a university student team that designs racecars. People looking to join can go in one of three streams, based on whether they&#039;d like to develop the frame\/steering\/mechanical aspects, the power and control system, or if they want to join the team that pitches it to businesses. Until last year, there were 33 people but this year the team&#039;s popularity exploded and many more joined.<br><br>When it was just a few people, all management was done exclusively through WhatsApp. I know it&#039;s terrible, but bear with me. Predictably, when more people joined, the old system of collaborating through WhatsApp turned into a fuckfest. As of right now, there&#039;s 17 different groups I&#039;m a part of and I&#039;m not even in Power Systems. <br><br>This year it falls to me to manage people, so what I was thinking of was using something like Discord. Have all communications centralized, but different channels and roles to not make the thing a fuckfest like it was. The thing is, no one wants to use Discord because of its privacy issues, since the data we have should be pretty private and secure. I&#039;m looking at a few alternatives, but I can&#039;t seem to decide on one. <br><br>Online I&#039;ve read that you should set up Mattermost, or RocketChat, or Wire. The problem is, we have to get everything approved by the university before we do it, and paying for web hosting isn&#039;t an option because the university is a crusty old fuck and doesn&#039;t hand out money. (South Asian university btw, which you&#039;ve probably already guessed). So I&#039;m kinda stuck. My requirements are(in order of priority): 1. Roles\/Channel system like Discord, or something very similar. <br>2. Centralized if possible, but FOSS.<br>3. Able to share images and voice call if possible.<br><br>Is there anything at all that I can use?

I could take courses in math\/comp sci that I could throw on my resume for future jobs, plus the same courses I want to take are the required classes for a data science MS program at a big 10 school in my state (this was not the school I went to for my bachelor&#039;s, I got my degree at a small state school). <br><br>I&#039;ve checked with admissions, and I&#039;m 99% sure I could take comp sci\/math classes as a non degree seeking student, finish the required classes, and apply to the MS program (granted my grades are good and I can do some research). I ended with a strong GPA, assisted with two years of undergrad research with one prof. I was planning on going to grad school for something similar to my undergrad degree, but after I graduated I had a sudden change of perspective. Even if I took a few of the classes and felt I didn&#039;t want to actually apply to the data science MS program, these classes would still look great on my resume and expand my experience with programming languages. Right now, I&#039;ve dabbled in the free online courses, but I know those free online courses don&#039;t compare to an actual college course. Still, taking these free online courses are helpful with understanding the very basic fundamentals of coding. <br><br>I work a tech &#039;related&#039; job in EHR database management (system specialist) for a healthcare organization. It pays decent and I I&#039;ve learned a lot from it. I want to continue to pursue jobs in healthcare tech or something in data analysis. My friend, who got the same major as me, also got a sweet job at a data analysis firm, so I know it&#039;s absolutely possible to get high earning jobs with just a 4 year degree and interest in breaking into these tech industries.
