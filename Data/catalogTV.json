Nothing they did was ethical or lawful, and no there is no georgia statute that allows to you to unilaterally imprison at gunpoint someone you think matches the appearance of a burglary suspect.","time":1588913841,"resto":133418158},{"no":133419126,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"where is the vid","time":1588913848,"resto":133418158},{"no":133419131,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and then everyone stood up and clapped<\/span><br>you retards are so fucking gullible","time":1588913858,"resto":133418158},{"no":133419133,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133419059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133419059<\/a><br>Whitey digging deep, pulling straws.","time":1588913858,"resto":133418158},{"no":133419143,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133419009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133419009<\/a><br>probably shouldn&#039;t spook someone with a fucking shotgun.","time":1588913880,"resto":133418158}],"last_modified":1588913880},{"no":133417358,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:08:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HOW MUCH IS LEAKED","com":"How much of this Movie is out Some people telling me 4 hrs some saying the whole thing","filename":"867","ext":".png","w":943,"h":854,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1588910889366,"time":1588910889,"md5":"Lmud9HhzI81FmkqDX2DJrg==","fsize":564639,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-much-is-leaked","custom_spoiler":5,"replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":133418351,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:35:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"I can&#039;t believe they&#039;re making a HBO show of this shit.","time":1588912511,"resto":133417358},{"no":133418417,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:37:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418351<\/a><br>If you&#039;d seen Westworld you&#039;d believe it in a heartbeat","time":1588912635,"resto":133417358},{"no":133418811,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:48:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418351<\/a><br>how is it shit? the first one has one of the best stories told in any medium.

Of course he ran awkwardly, but I was just never able to run. I was maybe 40 yards ahead of him, and I was only 100 yards away from the finish line. The whole class turned and began rooting for the young retarded boy\u2014cheering him, saying, \u2018C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, beat Spielberg! Run, run! It was like he came to life for the first time, and he began to pour it on but still not fast enough to beat me. And I remember thinking, \u2018OK, now how am I gonna fall and make it look like I really fell?\u2019 And I remember actually stepping on my toe and going face hard into the red clay of the track and actually scraping my nose. Everybody cheered when I fell, and then they began to really scream for this guy: \u2018C\u2019mon, John, c\u2019mon, run, run!\u2019 I got up just as John came up behind me, and I began running as if to beat him but not really win, running to let him win. We were nose to nose, and suddenly laid back a step, then half step. Suddenly he was ahead, then he was a chest ahead, then a length, and then he crossed the finish line ahead of me. Everybody grabbed this guy, and threw him on their shoulders and carried him into the locker room, and into the showers, and I stood there on the track field and cried my eyes out for five minutes.

TL;DR<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Josh Trank was the obvious candidate to reinvigorate the Fantastic Four for 20th Century Fox. In the mid-2000s, a pair of lighthearted films led by Jessica Alba and Chris Evans failed to break through in a zeitgeist captured by Christopher Nolan\u2019s gritty reinvention of Batman. Fox hoped that a modern sensibility could take the property in a new direction. Trank voiced his interest, and though Fox executives offered him the chance to pursue something original, the Marvel movie \u201cfelt like the most rebellious thing to do,\u201d the director said. His take on the material made him confident. A company buying into his hype made him bullheaded. Fox didn\u2019t want to make another Fantastic Four movie \u2014 it wanted to make Josh Trank\u2019s Fantastic Four movie.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trank&#039;s first move was to hire his friend Jeremy Slater as his writer. &quot;There wasn\u2019t really any sort of traditional pitching process,\u201d Slater said of his first days on the film. &quot;Josh just said, \u2018Jeremy is writing it for me,\u2019 and Fox nervously said, \u2018Uhh ... sure.&#039;&quot; They began work in the spring of 2012.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trank came to Slater with a skeleton idea: His Fantastic Four would be the opposite of every other franchise kickoff. \u201cThe end of the Fantastic Four was going to very organically set up the adventure and the weirdness and the fun. That would be the wish fulfillment of the sequel. Because obviously, the sequel would be, \u2018OK, now we are superpowered forever and it\u2019s weird and funny and there\u2019s adventure lurking around every corner.\u2019 But the first movie was going to basically be the filmic version of how I saw myself all the time: the metaphor of these characters crawling out of hell.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1588822955697","ext":".png","w":1262,"h":707,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1588904039126,"time":1588904039,"md5":"nx0k6Z8YK7iSfSMK61DpFw==","fsize":1123615,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-really-happened-to-josh-tranks-fantastic","custom_spoiler":5,"replies":66,"images":12,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":7,"last_replies":[{"no":133418373,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133413109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133413109<\/a><br>Evan Hannemann and Benjamin Papac are relentlessly handsome.","time":1588912553,"resto":133413109},{"no":133418587,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133413639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133413639<\/a><br>Agreed.

What you&#039;ve been referring to as the &quot;coronavirus&quot; is in fact SARS\/HIV, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it SARS+HIV. Coronavirus is not a disease unto itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning bioweapon made by the CCP. Many people suffer from a modified strain of HIV today, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of HIV used today is often called COVID, and many of it&#039;s users are not aware that it is basically HIV, developed by the Chinese government. There really is a Coronavirus, and these people have it, but it is just a part of a complete genetically engineered bioweapon. Coronavirus is the delivery mechanism: the container of various payloads encoded into RNA. Coronavirus is an essential part of SARS+HIV, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a good spike protien. SARS is normally used in combination with the HIV virus: the whole affliction is basically viral pneumonia with AIDS added, or SARS\/HIV. All the so called &quot;COVID-19&quot; victims are really sufferers of SARS\/HIV.","time":1588913776,"resto":133418794},{"no":133419103,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the world is basically on lockdown because a chink ate a bat <\/span><br><br>We really are living in the weirdest timeline","time":1588913805,"resto":133418794}],"last_modified":1588913805},{"no":133401863,"now":"05\/07\/20(Thu)17:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"New Kevin James kino.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQA<wbr>J5QvD8BA&amp;feature=emb_logo","filename":"screenshot-twitter.com-2020.05.07-17_37_16","ext":".png","w":748,"h":510,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1588887683494,"time":1588887683,"md5":"4zBo2b9udX3rvfTuL1FtFg==","fsize":297806,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"new-kevin-james-kino","custom_spoiler":5,"replies":206,"images":37,"omitted_posts":201,"omitted_images":37,"last_replies":[{"no":133418902,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:51:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133414244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133414244<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know about you but personally I am sick of all these white gangsters walking around with their low-hanging pants, blasting their loud rap music, violently assaulting people, and generally being menaces to society<br>Why do whites do this?

I have recently been thinking about something similar myself how wuxia films in general are underrated by international audiences and I guess you can extend that to HK cinema in general. I think in both cases there is a tendency to view them as simply genre\/cult and not much more. Take wuxia films for example, they often employ bright colors and sets, employ supernatural elements, give some characters make-up to age them or have beards and are set hundreds of years ago to periods Western audiences have little knowledge of. All of this combines to view the films as novelty of just a fun watch. But like I replied to that post above I think you can easily compare wuxia to westerns or samurai films which people, two genres of film people have no trouble regarding as art if the film is regarded &quot;good&quot; or &quot;classic&quot;. And indeed if you look at any list of the greatest Chinese language films by Chinese critics you&#039;ll see Dragon Inn or Touch of Zen in the top 10 or better which would surprise internationals who simply view them in the context of genre\/cult. I don&#039;t know how you really change that though other then by explaining it to people.","time":1588913308,"resto":133401439}],"last_modified":1588913308},{"no":133418788,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:48:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"So troyans had 0 hairloss and 0 MPB???

Movie made me wanna pick up the book immediately right after.","filename":"220px-Parasite_Eve_film_poster","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":314,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1588913229907,"time":1588913229,"md5":"GDHEbv\/wYIneIl1onh5Cfg==","fsize":20668,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"parasite-eve","custom_spoiler":5,"replies":3,"images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":133418782,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:48:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418738<\/a><br>I like the game i wanna jizz in aya and eve","time":1588913293,"resto":133418738},{"no":133418809,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418782<\/a><br>The actress for eve was pretty hot in the movie.","time":1588913330,"resto":133418738},{"no":133418915,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:51:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133418782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133418782<\/a><br>Also the movie takes place before the games, so it sets up why eve looks\/is made the way she is.

It was 2 years ago. I had had a very bad perianal abscess and developed a fistula on my ass cheek, I had surgery and they slashed s giant gash in me from the fistula to my asshole, about 3 inch long and 4 inches deep and ran a plastic tie thru the hole, into my rectum, back out of my asshole and tied it together.<br><br>After he surgery, they warned me about constipation and told me to take a ton of stool softeners. The anesthesia slows down your body and makes your poop hard. So I had a huge hard turd in me and a massive wound around my ass that made pushing out poop insanely painful like shitting a knife. Not to mention the poop would move the plastic ziptie thru the wound.<br><br>I didn&#039;t shit for 5 days, became incredibly painful. Doctor gave me the choice between driving 30 min to him to do a &quot;digital extractions&#039; aka he scoops my shit out with his finger, vs me taking a few enemas.<br><br>I started with one, waited 15 minutes and couldn&#039;t poop so I added another and another. Finally I let out a hard little painful nug of poop. I was crying from the pain and turned on the shower to clean myself off since I couldn&#039;t just wipe shit into the hash.<br><br>As soon as the hot water hit my stomach, I felt an urge, and I couldn&#039;t get out in time. I shit a massive amount of feces into the shower, a huge mound the most shit I&#039;ve ever seen in my life, it was a fucking ant hill. I used paper towels to try and pick it up and throw it into the toilet but then I just kept farting out water so I stayed in the shower until it was time to shit again and then dropped another massive pile of custard onto the shower floor.<br><br>That was 2 years ago, now I use that tub to wash my 1 year old son in.","time":1588910882,"resto":133416831},{"no":133417364,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ginger Snaps<br>Annihilation<br>Cabin Fever","time":1588910894,"resto":133416831},{"no":133418209,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:30:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133417116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133417116<\/a><br>Doing shit unironically was the downfall of this board.","time":1588912234,"resto":133416831},{"no":133418406,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133417353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133417353<\/a><br>Did you ever take the shit out?","time":1588912615,"resto":133416831},{"no":133418583,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p133417265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;133417265<\/a><br>virgin hands typed this","time":1588912940,"resto":133416831}],"last_modified":1588912940},{"no":133418366,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)00:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"AAAAAAAHHHHHHH I&#039;M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU YOU RICKETY OLD PIECE OF SHIT!
