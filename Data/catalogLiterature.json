In other words, human beings are only different from one another in superficial and shallow ways. None of what I&#039;m saying is new or original, I became aware of this through data gathering just like right now your data is telling you you&#039;re special and unique and self aware and a real person.

Myshkin describes religion as an immensely strong feeling similar to the joy God feels for his creation\u2014a feeling he recognizes when he sees a young mother joyously nursing her baby. Much like the idea that religion is a feeling rather than a set of rules that one follows, Myshkin Christ-like character can also be reduced to a feeling: his immense compassion and love for others.<br><br>Dostoevsky explores the idea of redemption in a series of characters who are condemned. Myshkin, during his first meeting with the Yepanchins, tries to imagine the feelings of a condemned man prior to his execution. Later on, the novel unravels characters who\u2014much like the man standing near the scaffold and awaiting his execution\u2014stand on the brink of ruin. Such characters include the Swiss woman Marie, Nastassya Filippovna, Hippolite, Rogozhin, General Ivolgin, and even Aglaya. Myshkin offers some sort of hope\u2014if not the complete reversal of the death sentence, then at least the softening of the psychological suffering it inflicts upon the condemned.<br><br>The Idiot is also full of sinners, from harmless drunkards like General Ivolgin to habitual liars and rogues like Ferdyshchenko, Lebedev, Keller, Doktorenko and even murderers like Rogozhin. Prince Myshkin spends a considerable amount of time with all of these sinners, even after many of them have committed offenses against him.

To be honest, I can sympathize with the latter group to some degree - it really is kind of crass and low-class to hate the weak. Despite the Right&#039;s rhetoric in America about seeing people as equals, not seeing skin color, meritocracy etc. we all know that it just means &quot;employing or associating with fewer blacks&quot;, and despite leftist rhetoric about equality we all know that black life in the US would be hopeless without liberal patrimony. I&#039;m not ragging on leftists for seeing most blacks as large children - they kind of are, and those in power also have obligations towards those beneath them.

The only downside about German is that some Germans pronounce their Rs like in that homosexual and disgusting ape screech known as French. I want my Rs to sound like Rs, not like fucking sickening phlegms from subhuman throats. And also they sometimes don&#039;t finish their words! Think British English (the non-rhotic dialects). But then German literature is literally GODLIKE and it&#039;s worth the price of admittance alone, so it&#039;s all forgiven! Sadly the modern German person is a burgerized pussyllanimous bugman! Their literature should be the main focus, not the unworthy social aspect. Either way, this tongue is unparalleled. The thinking man&#039;s language. Latin of the 21st century.","filename":"1584567245850","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1588990541281,"time":1588990541,"md5":"JEDDXtJ9a0Ag9JazlgOvaA==","fsize":5177,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-german-language","custom_spoiler":1,"replies":80,"images":4,"omitted_posts":75,"omitted_images":4,"last_replies":[{"no":15320016,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)18:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p15320013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15320013<\/a><br>you mean (((kramer)))","time":1589062823,"resto":15313417},{"no":15320138,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)18:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p15313603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15313603<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;durrr the family of language is the language being described<\/span><br>Kill yourself.","time":1589063701,"resto":15313417},{"no":15320165,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)18:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p15313795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15313795<\/a>","filename":"BE7B338A-642F-4360-B866-9A50E13E78A1","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":1002,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1589063882138,"time":1589063882,"md5":"nk60vHKOZ\/xMKQewL8ru1g==","fsize":112505,"resto":15313417},{"no":15320182,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)18:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p15319974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15319974<\/a><br>No, Grass was better","time":1589063960,"resto":15313417},{"no":15320215,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)18:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p15319974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15319974<\/a><br>He was among the best, along with Hesse, Traven and Boell<br><br><a href=\"#p15320182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;15320182<\/a><br>nah","time":1589064109,"resto":15313417}],"last_modified":1589064109},{"no":15311964,"now":"05\/08\/20(Fri)18:17:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;It should be pointed out that Pessoa smoked 80 cigarettes a day.&quot; -New York Times<\/span><br><br>Surely this is bullshit.
