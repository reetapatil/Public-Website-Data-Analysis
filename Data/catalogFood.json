They want to reduce the number of animals who have to endure horrific experiences living in cramped conditions and being slaughtered at a young age.<br>Many people implicitly or explicitly believe that what&#039;s natural is good. Vegans reject this moral framework when it&#039;s used to defend omnivorism on the grounds that humans are naturally omnivorous. Yet, animal-rights advocates are not always so quick to reject the appeal to nature when it comes to wild-animal suffering. Many of them are environmentalists; they harbor the false assumption that animals are happy in the wild, and would therefore support habitat preservation.<br>Nature is not optimized for compassion; it&#039;s optimized by the cold, harsh forces of evolution. Billions of wild vertebrates and quadrillions of wild invertebrates are suffering right now across the globe. This is an urgent tragedy.<br>Some insect species have life expectancies at birth measured in days or weeks, and most deaths are quite painful. It seems likely that wild animals as a whole experience more suffering than happiness, in which case we would hope to prevent their births, just like vegans want to prevent the births of factory-farmed animals.<br>80% of Amazon deforestation stems from cattle ranching. Given that rainforests are home to some of the highest densities of wild-animal populations (and hence wild-animal suffering) on Earth, this appears to be a consideration in favor of beef consumption.<br>When cattle eat vegetation on pasture fields, they presumably leave less vegetation left over to be eaten by bugs (and other organisms). Hence, cattle grazing on the whole reduces bug populations (and therefore, bug suffering) on pasture fields.","time":1589068696,"resto":14058085},{"no":14060636,"now":"05\/09\/20(Sat)20:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p14058085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14058085<\/a><br>I too have thoughts, feelings and feel pain and I&#039;m pretty sure animals would gladly consume my flesh without regret.
